Software and hardware for indoor and outdoor 3D-mapping

At the moment there are no ready-to-use 3d mapping solutions available for reasonable prices.

So far I did not find any handheld/portable 3D mapping devices that would be suitable for indoor and outdoor mapping.

If you are lucky and have ~8000$ you can buy a used terrestrial laser scanner that can store the scan without an additional computer.

New terrestrial laser scanners start at ~12000$

Of course there there is photogrammetry, but this is not optimal in all cases.

This is a try to collect open source software for 3D mapping and supported hardware.
The software setup should be easy.

Many popular and affordable RGB-D cameras are no longer available.

# Stereo cameras

Many models available. 

# RGB-D cameras

Only a few (older) models available

# LIDAR

Low budget LIDAR scanners are 2D scanners. 3D scanners are also available much cheaper than some years ago, but all available scanners are not ready to use for production mapping and require some setup, API calls...
